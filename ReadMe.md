# About
A sample code (check [sample.py](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/python-multiprocessing/blob/master/sample.py)) demonstrate multiprocessing technique in Python with smart fridge scenario (Internet of Things). Enter `python sample.py` to launch the code (see below screenshot). The full version of IoT project can be found at my another GitHub repository [Smart Fridge](https://github.com/woo-chia-wei/iot-smart-fridge).
